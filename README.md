# Neighborhood Connect

Neighborhood Connect is a web app that lets community leaders share their residents' top priorities with local government. Local government can share actions on these priorities and opportunities to participate.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get this project setup for development you'll need:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [Neighborhood Connect API](https://github.com/code4sac/neighborhood-connect-api)

### Installing and Running

Ensure you have the prerequisites installed, and the Neighborhood Connect API running.

By default Neighborhood Connect expects the dev API to be running on ```http://localhost:3000``` per ```.src/config.js```

From a terminal run:

```
git clone https://github.com/code4sac/neighborhood-connect/
cd neighborhood-connect
npm install
```
To start the app run:
```
npm start
```
With the local dev API already running on the default port 3000, you'll be prompted to run this app on another port.
